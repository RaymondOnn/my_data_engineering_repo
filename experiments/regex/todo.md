- Lazy Evaluation
- Better to ensure all `regexp` are RegExp instances or string?
- For classes.py, `.only()` method 
  ``` py
  Digit().only('5', '4')
    
  # self.pattern = [4-5] OR [45]
  ```
- Where to pull `negate()`?
  - negate used in classes, assertions
- Literal() and how it affects __repr__
- core.Literal: Buggy behaviour
- core.xclude: What if pattern is [^...]?
- class.Letter" \w includes underscore
- assertion.Between: Review Code
- Regex Flags
- Error Handling and Tests
