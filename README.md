# The Data Engineering Repo
This repository serves as a place to store my projects and experiments related to data engineering.


### Getting Started
- This repository is structured like a monorepo with projects-specific virtual environments.
- Currently it uses `pdm` for installing dependencies. 
- There is a virtual environment per library/project, to allow dependencies to diverge when needed. 
- Editable installs are used for dependencies, so that changes to a library are reflected immediately in code depending on the said library.
